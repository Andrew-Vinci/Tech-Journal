                        > Cryptocurrency is a digital form of currency that is exchanged
                        between entities/peers without the need of a third party, such as
                        a bank. Cryptocurrencies aim for full transparency using block chain 
                        tehchnology and allow for individuals to conduct transactions securely.

                        > Individuals can purcahse and sell the cryptocurrency of their choice
                        on block chain with anonomity to their personal identity, while providing validation
                        and adding security to the transaction. The network that these transactions take place on are 
                        made up of a chain of computers, which are required to approve the transaction in order to
                        prevent the issue of duplicate transactions.

                        and enforced by the study of cryptography. Cryptography is the study of secure communication techniques that
                        allow for a sender and reciever to view the contents of a message securely. This is the backbone of
                        the technology behind cryptocurrencies and is what allows for secure, anonymous payments that can be tracked via the block chain.

                <p class = cryptoExplained1>
                    > The idea of cryptocurrencies originated before the invention of Bitcoin.
                    The first idea and concept of cryptocurrency originated in the 1980's with the 
                    invention of what is called "blinded money". Blinded money uses what is known as 
                    a "blinding" algorithim that is crucial to modern web-based encryption. 
                    The algorithim allows for secure, unalterable information to be exchanged between different parties.
                </p>
                <p class = cryptoExplained1>
                    The first cryptocurrency that was invented using this algorithim was called "DigiCash".
                    DigiCash was a privately help company that eventually went bankrupt in the 1990's after failing to secure partnerships and having
                    one with Microsoft fall through that would have allowed early windows users to buy the currency,
                    due to lack of an agreement upon terms.
                </p>
                <p class = cryptoExplained1>
                    The main difference between this version of cryptocurrency and 
                    todays version in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others is that DigiCash was not
                    decentralized. Actually, similar to how cash works today, the DigiCash company controlled the entire
                    supply of their digital currency, making it a centralized platform similar to the way banks work today.
                </p>
