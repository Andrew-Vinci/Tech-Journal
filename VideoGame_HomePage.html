                        > Cryptocurrency is a digital form of currency that is exchanged
                        between entities/peers without the need of a third party, such as
                        a bank. Cryptocurrencies aim for full transparency using block chain 
                        tehchnology and allow for individuals to conduct transactions securely.

                        made up of a chain of computers, which are required to approve the transaction in order to
                        prevent the issue of duplicate transactions.

                        the technology behind cryptocurrencies and is what allows for secure, anonymous payments that can be tracked via the block chain.

                <p class = cryptoExplained1>
                    > The idea of cryptocurrencies originated before the invention of Bitcoin.
                    The first idea and concept of cryptocurrency originated in the 1980's with the 
                    invention of what is called "blinded money". Blinded money uses what is known as 
                    a "blinding" algorithim that is crucial to modern web-based encryption. 
                    The algorithim allows for secure, unalterable information to be exchanged between different parties.
                </p>
                <p class = cryptoExplained1>
                    > The first cryptocurrency that was invented using this algorithim was called "DigiCash".
                    DigiCash was a privately help company that eventually went bankrupt in the 1990's after failing to secure partnerships and having
                    one with Microsoft fall through that would have allowed early windows users to buy the currency,
                    due to lack of an agreement upon terms.
                </p>
                <p class = cryptoExplained1>
                    > The main difference between this version of cryptocurrency and 
                    todays version in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others is that DigiCash was not
                    decentralized. Actually, similar to how cash works today, the DigiCash company controlled the entire
                    supply of their digital currency, making it a centralized platform similar to the way banks work today.

                <p class = cryptoExplained2>
                    > Bitcoin is regarded as the first modern day example of a cryptocurrency.
                    It is the first publicly used means of exchange to combine decentralized control,
                    user anonymity, record-keeping via a blockchain, and built-in scarcity. It's initial plan
                    was first outlined in a 2008 white paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto.
                </p>
                <p class = cryptoExplained2>
                    > No one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. In 2010, he quietly exited development of Bitcoin and turned the project over
                    to a man named Gavin Andreson. He disappeared with over 1.5 million Bitcoin(s) and hasn't been 
                    heard from since. The amount of wealth that he is currently esitimatd to have is over $54 Billion.
                </p>
                <p class = cryptoExplained2>
                    > Many differnt cryptocurrencies that exist today started with the source code for Bitcoin and 
                    have expanded it to do a variety of different things to differentiate themselves. 
                    Some developers took the code and prioritized speed to create coins with easier transactions(nano),
                    some developers are prioritizing security, while others are aiming to be more of a utilitarian token (Ethereum).

                units of the currency at any given point in time. It is the record keeper of

                a new entry is entered into the master ledger.

                software network. This network is made up of decentralied server farms, run by people known 
                as miners. These miners help to contribute and continually records and authenticates the

                > In order for a cryptocurrency transaction to be finalized, it must be added to the 
                blockchain. This process usually takes a few minutes to be executed. During the time between
                the transactions initialization and finalization, the currency isnt available for use for the 
                sender or receiver. They are essentially held in a "limbo" state until the transacation is complete
                and the record has been recorded on the blockchain. This remedies the issue of creating a double-spending 
                scenario and thus limiting manipulation of the digital asset, 
                since in order for the currency to be used it must first be recorded.
